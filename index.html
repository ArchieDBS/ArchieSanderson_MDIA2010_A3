                                YouthRank ID: 2057_b566 <br>
                                Date of Appeal Submission: 14/07/2057 <br>
                                Appeal ID: APL-77534-Z <br>
                                <br><br> <br> <br>

                                -Reason for audit- <br> <br>
                                Following the release of the subject's tertiary eligibility outcome, the legal guardians have lodged an appeal - citing discrepancies between the subject’s academic achievement profile and her assigned Vocational Pathway Tier (Tier 3 – Essential Services Stream) <br><br><br> <br>

                                -Review Procedure- <br> <br>
                                The audit review board conducted a full re-evaluation of: <br>
                                The subject’s Learner Potential Score (LPS) history <br>
                                Cognitive Evaluation metrics (Form C-2B) <br>
                                Geographic & economic zone weighting (Zone 4B: West-Syd) <br>
                                Predictive career trajectory algorithms <br> <br> <br> <br>

                                -Findings- <br> <br>
                                Cognitive Evaluation Summary - 
                                Strong analytical skills identified alongside high conformity scores. <br> <br>
                                Excessively high empathy score flagged as "potential misalignment" with high-demand tertiary tracks (AI Engineering, Strategic Policy, Risk Brokerage) <br> <br>
                                Zone Contextualisation Weighting - 
                                Applicant’s residency in Zone 4B —> Region Adjustment Coefficient (RAC) of -0.17 to LPS, consistent with standard parameters. <br> <br>
                                Trajectory Consistency Index (TCI) - 
                                Variation in academic performance (Term 4, Year 10) lowered overall aptitude rating due to academic inconsistencies <br> <br>
                                Assessment System Integrity - 
                                No algorithmic or procedural anomalies detected in scoring or placement allocation. <br> <br> <br> <br>

                                -Decision- <br><br>
                                The appeal is denied. Subject Bower remains ineligible for Tier 1 or Tier 2 tertiary education access. Vocational redirection recommendations stand as issued. <br> <br> <br> <br>

                                -Comments- <br> <br>
                                The subject’s file reflects promising but non-exceptional alignment with long-term strategic outcomes as defined by Federal Tertiary Allocation directives. Emotional sensitivity profiles suggest incompatibility with high-impact leadership streams. <br> No further review will be undertaken.

                                Placement Summary <br> <br>
                                Ms. Bower is currently completing her sixth month in the Tier 3 Vocational Placement Program, assigned to Picton Community Services, Zone 4B. Initial assessment reports identify strong baseline cognitive and emotional processing skills. Scoring indicates the applicant is meeting core performance benchmarks in empathy, task execution, and communication. <br> <br>
                                However, the placement provider has flagged ongoing behavioural irregularities, including diminished focus, critical commentary on task relevance, and refusal to adhere to certain procedural expectations. These patterns are not uncommon among candidates who experience difficulty adjusting to structured support-based roles. <br> <br> <br>
                                - Supervisor Comment (Transcript) - <br> <br>
                                “Jessica is emotionally attuned and exceptionally perceptive with clients. Her empathy score is among the highest we’ve encountered this cycle. She adapts well to complex interpersonal situations and demonstrates genuine concern for community welfare. <br> <br>
                                That said, she often raises questions about institutional processes, displays critical thinking in ways that challenge standard workflows, and has expressed frustration at the routine nature of her duties. While these are not necessarily flaws, they suggest a discomfort with the predictable, care-oriented scope of her current assignment.” <br> <br> <br>
                                Review Comments <br> <br>
                                Subject Bower’s empathy and social awareness profiles are notably strong, and were key determining factors in her Tier 3 assignment. These qualities are optimally utilised in care-based placements where relational labour is central and performance is best measured through compliance and emotional availability rather than innovation or critique. <br> <br>
                                While supervisor observations point to higher-level cognitive capabilities, these alone do not override core alignment metrics. Community Service remains a critical infrastructure pathway that benefits from candidates who possess precisely the qualities Ms. Bower demonstrates. However, such roles do not require or benefit from tertiary academic investment, particularly in the current resource environment.<br> <br>
                                Request for reassignment is denied. Placement remains appropriate.
